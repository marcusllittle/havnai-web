## 🚀 Vision  
AI is creating wealth — but not for its creators.  
HavnAI builds a decentralized layer where every workflow, model, and dataset becomes a **revenue-earning digital asset**.  

We call it **Proof of Creation** — the foundation of an economy that rewards human and machine intelligence equally.

---

## 💡 What Is HavnAI?  
HavnAI is an open protocol for **AI workflow royalties**.  
When your model, dataset, or automation powers another system, you keep earning — automatically.  
Whether you design, deploy, or run AI, your work is tokenized, traceable, and rewarded.

---

## 🪙 The $HAI Token  
The native token of the HavnAI network — **$HAI** — powers value flow between creators, operators, and users.

| Role | Earns $HAI By | Uses $HAI For |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Creators** | Publishing workflows/models that others build on | Royalties, staking reputation |
| **Operators** | Running compute or validation nodes | Fees, collateral |
| **Users** | Accessing verified AI intelligence | Licensing, subscriptions |

$HAI is more than currency — it’s **ownership of intelligence**.

---

## 🧩 Architecture (Preview)  
- **Workflow Registry** — On-chain signatures for AI pipelines  
- **Royalty Engine** — Automatic revenue sharing per execution  
- **Validation Network** — Staked nodes verify usage events  
- **Creator Dashboard** — Manage assets, earnings, and staking
