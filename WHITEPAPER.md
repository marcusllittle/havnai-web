## 1. Executive Summary  
AI is creating more value than any technology in human history — and almost none of that value goes to the people who actually build it.

The people who design workflows, train models, tune prompts, build automations, and run compute are generating real economic output. But today that output gets captured by centralized platforms, closed APIs, and cloud providers. The creators — humans and machines — get no ongoing share.

**HavnAI exists to change that.**

HavnAI is a protocol that turns AI workflows and intelligence into revenue-producing digital assets. When a workflow, model, or automation is executed in the network, a royalty is automatically paid out in $HAI to the contributors who made that workflow possible.

This is how AI becomes an economy — not just a service.  
This is how creators build once and continue to earn.

---

## 2. The Problem  
AI right now is extractive.

- Platforms lock in creators, then monetize their outputs at scale.
- A model can be reused millions of times by other people with zero credit or payout back to the original builder.
- There’s no standard for proving “who contributed what” to an AI workflow.
- There’s no native way to pay all contributors fairly every time that workflow runs.

The result:  
- Engineers build automations that companies quietly repeat.  
- Artists design diffusion workflows that others just clone.  
- Infra people run GPUs while someone else takes the margin.  
- Fine-tuners make models that get repackaged for resale.  

AI has productivity railroads.  
But the people laying the tracks don’t get equity in the rails.

The current system scales AI, but not ownership.

## 3. The HavnAI Solution  
HavnAI is the royalty layer for AI.

The protocol does three things:

### 3.1 Workflow Registry  
Creators can register AI workflows, models, and automations.  
Each registered workflow includes:
- who created it  
- what dependencies it uses (models, LoRAs, prompts, controlnets, etc.)  
- how revenue should be split when it’s used  

This creates a signed, referencable “this is mine” fingerprint for creative and technical work.

Think: Git for AI pipelines, but with economics attached.

### 3.2 Execution Tracking  
When someone runs a registered workflow in the network, the run is logged and verified.  
The network can tell:
- which workflow was executed  
- which assets were used  
- which node provided compute to make it happen

Every execution becomes provable.

### 3.3 Automated Royalty Distribution  
Once a run is verified, a payout is automatically triggered in $HAI.  
That payout is split between:
- the workflow creator  
- any upstream asset contributors (model authors, tuners, etc.)  
- the node operator that provided compute  
- the network treasury (sustainability, grants, incentives)

In other words:  
Every time someone uses your intelligence, you get paid.

## 4. The $HAI Token  
$HAI is the native token of the HavnAI network.  
It isn’t just a payment token — it’s how value flows, how trust is enforced, and how decisions get made.

### 4.1 Earn ($HAI comes to you)  
- **Creators** earn $HAI every time their workflow or model is executed.  
- **Asset Contributors** (like LoRA authors, model tuners) earn a share if they were part of that pipeline.  
- **Node Operators** earn $HAI for providing GPU/compute to execute workloads.  
- **Validators** earn $HAI for verifying that recorded runs are legit and not spoofed.

This is how HavnAI turns AI output into recurring income, not one-time sales.

### 4.2 Spend (you use $HAI to access intelligence)  
- Users spend $HAI to run AI workflows, generate assets, call automation pipelines, etc.  
- Teams and apps can pay in $HAI for access to high-quality, verified AI behaviors instead of rebuilding them.

This creates demand pressure on $HAI.  
As more people use workflows in the network, more $HAI circulates.

### 4.3 Stake (security and reputation)  
- Node operators may be required to stake $HAI to participate.  
  - If they cheat, lie about runs, or deliver garbage output: they get slashed.  
  - If they run clean, high-uptime compute: they earn more.  

This builds a “trust layer” in a decentralized compute network without relying on a single company.

### 4.4 Govern (protocol control)  
- $HAI holders participate in governance:  
  - Royalty split rules  
  - Registry rules for what counts as a unique workflow  
  - Treasury usage: funding grants, onboarding creators, bootstrapping GPU supply

Over time, $HAI holders collectively steer how intelligence is valued and distributed inside the network.

## 5. Network Model & Flow  
This is how value actually moves through HavnAI in practice:

1. **Creator publishes a workflow** to the HavnAI Registry.  
   - It could be an AI art pipeline, data-cleaning agent, trading agent, voice synth chain, etc.  
   - The creator defines the royalty split.

2. **User (person or app) runs that workflow** to generate something.  
   - They pay in $HAI for that execution.

3. **A compute node executes the workload.**  
   - That node proves it did the work.

4. **The run is verified.**  
   - Validators confirm it wasn’t faked.

5. **Royalties are distributed automatically in $HAI.**  
   - Creator gets paid.  
   - Contributors get paid.  
   - Node gets paid.  
   - Treasury gets its share.

6. **The event is recorded.**  
   - Now the creator has a public “this workflow has been run X times / has generated Y $HAI” history — a track record they can point to.

This is streaming income for intelligence.  
Not just views. Not just likes. Actual money.

## 6. Vision  
HavnAI is built on a simple belief:

If machines are going to generate wealth, that wealth should flow back to the people who made that machine intelligence possible.

We are moving from “AI as a tool you rent” to “AI as an economy you participate in.”

HavnAI does not exist to replace creators.  
HavnAI exists to make sure creators cannot be replaced in silence.

This is the shift:
- from extraction to participation  
- from closed platforms to open economics  
- from “you just gave us training data, thanks” to “you own part of what you created”  

HavnAI is not just infrastructure.  
HavnAI is an answer to the question:  
**Who gets paid for intelligence in a world where intelligence is everywhere?**

**Own Your Intelligence. Build once. Earn forever.**
