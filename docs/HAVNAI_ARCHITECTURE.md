## Protocol Overview
HavnAI is a decentralized intelligence fabric engineered for autonomous value creation. Every workflow, model, and derivative asset is registered as programmable yield, allowing contributors to earn in perpetuity as their intelligence propagates across the network. The $HAI token synchronizes execution, verification, and payouts without relying on a central broker.

### Design Principles
- Deterministic provenance for every workflow invocation
- Automated, trust-minimized value routing from execution to royalties
- Cryptoeconomic security that punishes fabrication and rewards verification
- Modular architecture that supports rapid iteration on-chain and off-chain

## On-Chain Layer
The smart contract suite transforms AI workflows into revenue-bearing assets and enforces accountability.

| Module | Function | Key State | Governance Hooks |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| WorkflowRegistry | Registers workflows, dependency graphs, and royalty topology | Workflow metadata, dependency hashes, dynamic split config | Approval lists, dispute escalation, derivative detection thresholds |
| ExecutionLog | Records canonical proof of execution with validator attestations | Job ID, workflow ID, caller, node, validator set, fee | Validator quorum size, signature schemes, windowing |
| PayoutRouter | Splits $HAI fees per registered topology | Pending payouts, claimant balances, treasury buffer | Default splits, streaming cadence, treasury skim |
| StakeGuard | Manages collateral for nodes and validators, triggers slashing | Stake balances, performance metrics, offence queue | Stake minimums, slash ratios, appeal process |

### WorkflowRegistry Mechanics
- Immutable workflow IDs issued via keccak hash of manifest
- Dependency graph stored as adjacency list enabling recursive royalty splits
- Governance-controlled attestors can flag plagiarism and trigger fee escrow

contract WorkflowRegistry {
    struct RoyaltyRoute {
        uint16 creatorBps;
        uint16 upstreamBps;
        uint16 nodeBps;
        uint16 validatorBps;
        uint16 treasuryBps;
    }

    mapping(bytes32 => RoyaltyRoute) public splitOf;

    function register(bytes32 workflowId, RoyaltyRoute calldata route) external {
        require(route.creatorBps + route.upstreamBps + route.nodeBps + route.validatorBps + route.treasuryBps == 10_000, "Invalid split");
        splitOf[workflowId] = route;
    }
}
```

### ExecutionLog Dynamics
- Accepts batched validator attestations using BLS aggregated signatures
- Anchors job metadata including compute class, runtime hash, and nonce
- Emits events consumed by payout agents and analytics oracles

### PayoutRouter Flow
- Executes pull-based claim model to minimize reverts
- Supports royalty streaming for large jobs through vesting buffers
- Integrates with treasury policy for on-chain diversification swaps

### StakeGuard Controls
- Multi-tier staking pools: GPU nodes, verifier nodes, orchestrator relays
- Automated slashing triggered by fraud proofs, downtime oracles, or governance votes
- Restaking hooks planned for future interchain security extensions

## Off-Chain Intelligence Fabric
Off-chain services provide high-throughput execution while respecting on-chain authority.

### Creator Interface
- CLI + SDK packaging workflows as encrypted manifests with dependency fingerprints
- Reputation layer surfaces proven earnings and validator approval scores
- Optional zero-knowledge proofs attach performance guarantees to listings

### Node Runtime
- Containerized execution engine (OCI images) with support for ComfyUI, Triton, custom LLM stacks
- Deterministic job runner that produces signed execution receipts for validator consumption
- Adaptive resource allocation driven by compute class metadata and demand forecasts

### Validator Mesh
- Independent verifiers replicate or challenge job outputs using probabilistic sampling
- Gossip network shares fraud proofs and stake challenge intents
- Coordinated checkpointing pushes aggregated signatures to the ExecutionLog

## Data and Value Flow
1. Creator publishes workflow manifest via WorkflowRegistry; upstream assets register dependencies.
2. User submits job specifying workflow ID, input payload hash, and compute class.
3. StakeGuard confirms node eligibility and bonds collateral.
4. Node completes execution, emits signed receipt, and broadcasts to validator mesh.
5. Validators quorum on receipt validity and push attestations to ExecutionLog.
6. ExecutionLog event triggers PayoutRouter distribution across royalty graph.
7. Treasury accrues strategic buffer; reputation index updates for all participants.

## Security Envelope
### Economic Defenses
- Slashing multipliers tied to repeat offences prevent griefing
- Dynamic quorum sizing responds to observed volatility and job value
- Treasury-funded insurance backstop stabilizes early-phase validator incentives

### Cryptographic Guarantees
- All manifests hashed with Poseidon-compatible circuits for future zk proofs
- Receipts double-signed by hardware enclaves where available
- Audit trail exposes every job lifecycle for independent security review

## Extensibility Roadmap
### Near-Term Upgrades
- Intent-based job routing with MEV-resistant ordering
- Cross-chain payout bridges for multi-domain treasury management
- Automated derivative detection using embedding similarity oracles

### Long-Term Vision
- Autonomous workflow cooperatives that self-adjust pricing based on demand
- Encrypted inference leveraging FHE-enabled nodes
- Interoperable staking with other AI economies under the Havn Alliance banner
