## Runtime Mandate
HavnAI nodes translate workflow demand into verifiable execution. Each node advertises deterministic capabilities, bonds $HAI collateral, and delivers cryptographically signed receipts that feed the validator mesh. The runtime prioritizes reproducibility, latency discipline, and autonomous scaling.

### Node Personas
| Persona | Description | Primary Stake | SLA Targets | Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Execution Node | Runs AI workloads (LLM, diffusion, audio) | High collateral proportional to compute class | <400ms queue admission, <2% timeout | Backbone of workflow economy |
| Orchestrator Relay | Routes jobs, maintains mempools, negotiates surge pricing | Moderate collateral | <50ms routing latency | Optional, improves load balancing |
| Archival Node | Stores encrypted manifests, receipts, and artifacts | Light collateral | 99.95% availability | Enables post-trade audits |

## Compute Classes
| Class | Profile | Suggested Hardware | Fee Multiplier | Collateral Floor |
|-------|---------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| S | Lightweight CPU tasks, prompt chaining | 8 vCPU / 16 GB RAM | 1.0x | 2,000 HAI |
| M | Mid-tier GPU inference (A10/A4000) | 24 GB VRAM, NVMe cache | 1.5x | 5,000 HAI |
| L | High-precision diffusion / fine-tuning | 40+ GB VRAM, 64 GB RAM | 2.5x | 9,000 HAI |
| XL | Multi-node, high VRAM, batching | Dual A100/H100 with NVLink | 4.0x | 18,000 HAI |

## Lifecycle Overview
1. Node bonds $HAI through StakeGuard and publishes capabilities manifest.
2. Orchestrator assigns job based on compute class, performance history, and surge pricing.
3. Node downloads encrypted payload, decrypts within TEE or secure enclave.
4. Runtime executes workflow graph, capturing deterministic metrics (runtime hash, gas-equivalent cost).
5. Node signs receipt, streams telemetry to validator mesh, and stores artifacts in archival tier.
6. Validators challenge or confirm; upon quorum, node claims payout from PayoutRouter.

## Job Intake Interface
Nodes expose authenticated gRPC and REST endpoints for orchestrators.

```python
@app.post("/job/accept")
def accept_job(payload: JobPayload):
    assert stake_guard.is_active(node_id)
    verify_capabilities(payload.workflow_id, payload.compute_class)
    ticket = queue.enqueue(payload)
    return {"ticket_id": ticket.id, "eta_seconds": ticket.eta}
```

### Payload Requirements
- Workflow ID referencing registered manifest
- Input artifact hashes (IPFS, Arweave, or custom storage)
- Compute class and timeout hints
- Optional privacy flags enabling enclave execution

## Execution Pipeline
### Preflight
- Validate manifest checksum against registry
- Warm container images and preload model weights
- Reserve VRAM and set deterministic random seed

### Runtime
- Stream tasks through DAG executor with checkpointing
- Emit heartbeat every 5 seconds to orchestrator and validators
- Capture GPU utilization, power draw, and latency telemetry

### Postflight
- Generate receipt: `{workflow_id, job_id, runtime_hash, outputs_cid, latency_ms, energy_estimate}`
- Sign receipt with node key stored in hardware-backed key vault
- Push artifacts to archival layer with erasure coding redundancy

## Validator Interaction
- Nodes broadcast receipts over libp2p topics segmented by compute class.
- Validators sample outputs; suspicious jobs trigger partial re-execution.
- Challenge protocol allows contested receipts to enter adjudication queue with stake at risk.

## Telemetry and Observability
### Metrics
- Job throughput, latency distribution, failure rate, slashing incidents
- Energy-adjusted carbon score for sustainability reporting

### Logging
- Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs for each workflow step
- Privacy-aware redaction ensuring no raw user data exits secure boundary

### Alerting
- SLA breaches notify node operator and orchestrator via encrypted webhooks
- Automatic stake quarantine if heartbeat drops below threshold for 3 consecutive epochs

## Security Discipline
- Mandatory secure boot and attested firmware for GPU hosts
- Secrets stored in TPM-backed vault; no plain-text keys on disk
- Periodic self-audits sign proof-of-software to attest runtime integrity

## Upgrade Path
### Short-Term Enhancements
- Deterministic container snapshots distributed via torrent-like swarm
- Embedded zk-proof generators for high-value workflows

### Long-Term Vision
- Fully autonomous nodes able to negotiate workloads via agentic marketplaces
- Integration with renewable microgrids for energy-aware scheduling
