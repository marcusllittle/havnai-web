## DAO Blueprint
The HavnAI DAO steers protocol evolution with a focus on sustaining decentralized intelligence markets. Governance fuses on-chain ballots, specialized councils, and cryptoeconomic checks so that $HAI holders shape policy without stalling innovation.

### Operating Principles
- Sovereign creators first: governance shields royalties and provenance
- Transparency by default: every parameter change emits auditable events
- Rapid response with layered vetoes to neutralize emergent threats

## Governance Organs
| Body | Composition | Mandate | Check and Balance |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Global Assembly | All $HAI holders via token-weighted vote | Ratify major protocol upgrades, elect councils, approve treasury budgets | Quorum 20%, supermajority 60% for constitutional changes |
| Policy Council | 7 elected delegates with rolling 6-month terms | Parameter tuning (fees, stake minima), emissions calibration | Subject to Assembly veto, multi-sig execution |
| Risk Committee | 5 technical/financial experts with bonded stake | Monitor slashing events, liquidity health, treasury risk | Emergency pause authority limited to 7-day window |
| Treasury Guild | DAO operational contributors | Execute approved spending, manage partnerships | Monthly reporting, Assembly can replace via vote |

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. Draft posted to governance forum with economic, technical, and risk analysis.
2. Temperature check snapshot requires simple majority with 10% participation.
3. Formal on-chain proposal submitted with bonded deposit to deter spam.
4. Voting window: 5 days standard, 48-hour fast-track for critical patches.
5. If approved, time-locked execution waits 48 hours for any guardian challenge.
6. Smart executor contract triggers parameter change or treasury transaction.

### Proposal Classes
| Class | Description | Voting Threshold | Additional Requirements |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Parameter Adjustment | Fee changes, stake minima, validator quorum | 55% yes | Policy Council review |
| Treasury Allocation | Grants, liquidity deployment, partnerships | 50% yes | Treasury Guild implementation plan |
| Protocol Upgrade | Contract replacements, new modules | 60% yes, 20% quorum | External audit confirmation |
| Emergency Action | Slash quarantine, emission halt | 66% yes within 48 hours | Risk Committee trigger, auto-expiry |

## Treasury Discipline
- Maintain multi-asset reserves with max 40% exposure to any counterparty.
- Bi-weekly nav reporting including yield strategies and liabilities.
- No off-chain spending without multi-sig approval mirrored on-chain.
- Grants distributed via milestone-based vesting with clawback triggers.

## Delegation Framework
### Delegate Requirements
- Bond minimum 50,000 $HAI as alignment stake.
- Publish voting rubric covering economic policy, security posture, and ecosystem growth.
- Submit quarterly performance report and open office hours.

### Voting Power Dynamics
- Delegators retain instant exit rights; redelegation delay = 1 epoch.
- Quadratic voting pilot planned for community bucket allocations.
- Anti-plutocracy guard: single delegate cap at 12% of total voting power.

## Compliance and Transparency
- Open-source governance contracts with on-chain audit trails.
- Real-time dashboards expose treasury inflows/outflows, stake metrics, and proposal status.
- Third-party forensic partners rotate quarterly to review validator behavior.

## Long-Term Governance Vision
- Progressive decentralization from council-heavy oversight to autonomous DAO modules.
- Encrypted ballots with zk-SNARK receipts to preserve voter privacy while guaranteeing integrity.
- Inter-DAO treaties enabling cross-network royalty sharing under the Havn Alliance charter.
